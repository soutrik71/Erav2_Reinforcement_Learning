# CS188-Project-3
In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

Files edited by me: qlearningAgents.py, analysis.py, valueIterationAgents.py

Custom code follows: "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
